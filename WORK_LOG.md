Number three still needs work, as it uses parseInt. I also finally got number 4 working. I think it's already fast and doesn't need more optimization. |
| Aug 28 | 2:15-2:45pm | I messed around with the fourth encryption scheme but couldn't get anything. The best I could get is converting from emoji to a decimal using https://r12a.github.io/app-conversion/ then reducing the decimal mod 8192 to cut it to one byte, then converting to ASCII. Unfortunately I don't think the solution is supposed to involve arabic. |

I spent a bit fiddling with the tester functions. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, but I did implement the first three algorithms. |
